input:
	We want to block every Google and YouTube domain with the TLDs specified in tld.
	Because Reddit has a TLD at the end, you will only see Reddit lines that end with ".com"
tld:
	We specify all TLDs that we want to combine with the domains specified in input.
	Note that the dot in front doesn't matter if it exists or not.
output:
	Doesn't exist yet, but doesn't matter.

If you want to test, if it works, remove the output file
I'm Linux with OpenJDK and have the .jar inside this folder so I don't have to type paths.

java -jar hostsGenerator.jar tld input output

if I had a head, it would be the first argument and I would have 4 arguments. This is not the case here.
Now you can go to exampleFiles and look at output.

I'm currently not sure, but I think in Windows, you don't have to type "java -jar" and can start directly at "hostsGenerator..."
